# About Me
I sometimes describe myself as the Swiss Army knife of people, because I am happiest and most engaged in roles where I can wear as many hats as possible. So far, my experience spans across technology, policy, ethics, cybersecurity, communication, and conflict management. I recently transitioned from my fellowship with the United States Digital Corps to a full time position at FedRAMP, where I drive automation and developer relations work (as well as anything else I have the capacity to be involved in).

My career spans both the public and private sector, including software development and data science work at NIST and NIH, solutions engineering at Salesforce, and patent engineering at Holland & Hart. My academic portfolio from the University of Colorado Boulder spanned human-AI social and romantic relationships, rootkits, and privacy-preserving platforms.

I don't truly understand something until I can explain it to a 4th grader-- accordingly, I have a knack for explaining a wide variety of technical concepts clearly. I combine technical skills with a passion for solving complex problems and a commitment to ethical technology.

In my free time, I volunteer for restorative justice facilitation and community mediation, and like to think of myself as a student of algorithms and society. My friends know me as bubbly but grounded, and you can find me greeting every single dog I encounter, crocheting while listening to an audiobook or video essay, and bopping to literally any genre of music.
