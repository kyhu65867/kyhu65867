# About Me
- I have superpower of being able to explain almost anything in terms a 4th grader could understand.
- My purpose in life is to solve problems through connections-- be that person to person, or discipline to discipline.
- I sometimes describe myself as the Swiss Army knife of people, because I am happiest and most engaged in roles where I can wear as many hats as possible.
- So far, my experience spans across technology, policy, ethics, cybersecurity, communication, and conflict management.
- I recently transitioned from my fellowship with the United States Digital Corps to a full time position at FedRAMP, where I drive automation and developer relations work (as well as anything else I have the capacity to be involved in).
- My career spans both the public and private sector, including software development and data science work at NIST and NIH, solutions engineering at Salesforce, and patent engineering at Holland & Hart.
- My academic portfolio from the University of Colorado Boulder spanned human-AI social and romantic relationships, rootkits, and privacy-preserving platforms.
- In my free time, I volunteer for restorative justice facilitation and community mediation
- I like to think of myself as a student of algorithms and society.
- My friends know me as bubbly but grounded, and you can find me greeting every single dog I encounter, crocheting while listening to an audiobook or video essay, and bopping to literally any genre of music.
